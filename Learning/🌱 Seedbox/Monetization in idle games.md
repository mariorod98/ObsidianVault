# Monetization in idle games
- **Cash infusion**. Give instant resources.
    - Based on the resource generation at the moment.
    - Using a **Time warp** that moves the game a set amount of time. Giving the player the resources the would have earned in that time and substracting that time to the game cooldowns.
- **Permanent upgrades**. I.E: permanent x3 multiplier.
- **Instant prestige**. Gain a prestige level without resetting the progress.
- **Protection against negative events**.
- **Gacha system**. Random drops of upgrades.
- **Event currency**.
- **Banner/Interstitial ads**. Adds that are displayed while playing the game and that don't disrupt the gameplay.
- **Opt-in ads**. Ask the player to watch an add for an instant reward: short burst of cash, small bit of premium currency, brief powerful boost, medium-length small boost.
