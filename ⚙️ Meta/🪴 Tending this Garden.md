# 🪴 Tending this Garden

It's Garden, with capital `G`, because this is my [[Digital garden]].

## Setup

See the [[Folder structure]] in place and the [[Tag taxonomy]].

Some [[Obsidian plugins|Plugins]] have been installed.

## How to

**Newly created notes** are automatically put within the `🌱 Seedbox` folder.

The **emoji** selector can be brought with `Ctrl+Shift+,` (this shortcut can be changed in the `Hotkeys` section in the `Options` dialog).
