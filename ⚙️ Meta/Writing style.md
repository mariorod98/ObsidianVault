# Writing style

Definitions on how to use the different markdown elements

## Titles
- # H1. Reserved for the name of the note
- ## H2. Used to divide the note in different sub concepts
- ### H3. Used when a sub concept has different elements that require explanation too big to use lists
- #### H4. Should be used very rarely. At this point, the note should be refactored into multiple sub notes.
- ##### H5. Should never be used.

## Highlight text
- **Bold**. Used to remark the most important concepts that should stick out when doing a quick reading of the note. Usually single words or small sentences.
- *Italic*. Used to put emphasis on small words or sentences. Don't have to be important concepts in the note.
- ***Bold and italic***. Extremely important concept with a lot of emphasis!!!
- ==Highlight==. Used to remark knowledge that I tend to forget. In programming, this could be a common pitfall; in math it could be an assumption or consequence of a theorem that I find interesting.

## Lists
There are no restrictions on when to use unordered or ordered lists except for the size of its elements. if the elements are too big to clearly see the list structure, it should be changed to sub sections.

## Code
- Inline code is used to specify that I am talking about a specific element in a programming language or from a piece of code block defined before or after the text.
- Code blocks always have to have the language defined. Having different code blocks that relate to each other should be avoided.

## Quotes and callouts
> Quotes and callouts should be used for formal mathematical definitions and for general examples.

## Footnotes
Footnotes can be used to add extra information that is not necessary to the understanding of what is being discussed or to add a direct cite.
