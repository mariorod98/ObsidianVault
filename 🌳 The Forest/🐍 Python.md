# 🐍 Python
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.

Python is the most used programming language in [[📋 Data Science]].

Some basic concepts are:
- [[Lambda expressions]]
- [[Iterables]]
- [[Parallel programming in Python]]

The basic structures are:
- [[A list is a mutable sequence of typically homogenous elements]]
- [[A tuple is an immutable sequence of elements]]
- [[Dictionary]]
- [[Set]]

Some important concepts about *functions* are:
- [[Functions can be defined in three different scopes]]
- [[You can reference global and nonlocal variables inside functions]]
- [[Parameters are passed by reference]]
- [[There are positional and keyword arguments]]
- [[Keyword parameters can have default values]]
- [[You can specify an arbitrary number of arguments for functions]]
- [[Functions always return a single object]]

Some useful functions for iterables are:
- [[Reduce function|Reduce]]
- [[Filter function|Filter]]
- [[Map function|Map]]

Some useful libraries are:
- [[pandas]]
- [[functools]]
- [[datetime]]
- [[numpy]]
- [[matplotlib]]
- [[scikit-learn]]
