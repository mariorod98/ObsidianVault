# Idle Game Core Mechanics
- **Progress without interaction.** You can keep the game idle for a while and you will be making ==slow but constant progress==.
    - This prompts **celebratory moments**. Every time you check in after idle time, the game greets you with info about how much you have progress while being away.
    - The longer you are away, the more you have accomplished, therefore the player doesn't feel punished for idling.
- **Profitable quick check-ins**. The player must be compelled to check in the game routinely to buy upgrades and make huge advances. -> Great for mobile patterns.
- **Rapid growth of costs and rewards**. Leads to increased sense of progress, psychologically fun and satisfying. It counterbalances offline play -> time loses value without interaction.
    - The rewards growth should start bigger than the costs growth but grow slower. The game will reach a point where the player will have to reset to keep playing.
- **Tons of goals and achievements** that provide moments of joy spread out through the experience. 
    - They allow for moment-to-moment optimization and (temporarily) meaningful choices (min-maxing). E.g.: what upgrade to get next?
- **Core loop: log in, spend all cash, log out and return in a few hours**.
- **New Game+/Prestige levels**. The player can choose to reset the game to get a boost to the next playthrough. 
    - Provides a crucial strategic decision for the player. A point of no return.
    - You can tie a new currency to the resets that unlock permanent upgrades between resets. These upgrades lets you transform exponential growth back to linear.

    - Leads to a new gameplay loop.
    - Gives a great sense of progress, you buy the early upgrades almost instantly once you reset.
- **Regular updates**. Simple design and code allows for rapid iteration to balance or add features & content. For an adult game to succeed, it has to be regularly updated with new content.
- Smooth and expectable progress is boring and lacks surprise. **Make progress unexpected by making the progress growth *bumpy*** by altering the growth curve.
    - When prestiging, the bumpy progress will make different areas where the reward growth is zigzaging between being above and below the cost progress.
