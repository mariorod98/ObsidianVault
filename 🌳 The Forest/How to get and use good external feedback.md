# How to get and use good external feedback

1. **Trust the first impressions**. The longer you keep playing, you grow more accustomed to the errors or inconveniences found earlier. Write down each though you have as soon as it comes to your mind.
2. **Do not interfere with the tester experience**. Do not talk to the tester, give clues or explain anything to the tester. The best option is to record the tester reactions in an empty room. Your presence can and will influence the tester.
3. **Target your audience as accurate as possible**.  If the testing target does not like the game, it means big trouble. Getting feedback from a diverse range of people is important, but satisfying your target audience is critical.
4. **Avoid using test levels that contain bugs**. As soon as a tester finds a bug, the player will focus or remember it and it will influence the whole test, devaluating it.
5. **Do not discuss the results of the test with the tester**. Do not try to explain to the tester why they had that reaction or what they should have done. If the tester gave negative feedback, do not argue with them.
6. **Learn to sift through the feedback**. If a lot of testers have negative feedback on a feature or aspect of the game, it must be prioritized. If only a few testers have complained about it, it can be left aside momentarily.
7. **Use feedback during all the development**. When you collect feedback from testers, don't use it and throw it away when you are done. Keep it to compare with future feedbacks or to return to them further down development.
