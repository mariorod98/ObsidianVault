# IVT Game jam 2024 - Bad is Good

Three ways that we can adapt the theme to a game:
- The goal of the game is to perform as bad as possible. The worse you perform, the better score you get.
- The goal of the game is to do or achieve something that in videogames is usually bad.
- The game gets progressively worse as you advance, so the worse it gets, the better you are.

## The worse you perform, the better score

## The goal is to do something commonly bad in videogames

## The worse it getrs the better you are
