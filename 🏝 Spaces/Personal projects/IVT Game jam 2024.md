# IVT Game jam 2024 - Bad is Good

Three ways that we can adapt the theme to a game:
- The goal of the game is to perform as bad as possible. The worse you perform, the better score you get.
- The goal of the game is to do or achieve something that in videogames is usually bad.
- The game gets progressively worse as you advance, so the worse it gets, the better you are.

## The worse you perform, the better score
- A singing game where your objective is to sing as off pitch as possible. The goal could be to do as opposite pitch as possible (so if the note to hit is a high note you sing it as low as possible). We could also add during the son special short phases where you have to do something like constantly switch pitch or keep a note for a period of time.

## The goal is to do something commonly bad in videogames
- A local coop game where the objective is to be the first one to die. Similar to duck game. We can have a map with different hazards and the objective is to die to those hazards the first. We can add mechanics to avoid other players from beind damage like pushing them or giving them a shield or inmobilizing them.
- A game where you have an AI player trying to get the highest score and your objective is to avoid the AI from getting score. For example if they have to shoot enemies, putting obstacles or moving the enemies away. Maybe you could have a set of actions (push/pull/pick/smash) with cooldowns and you have to find imaginative ways to avoid it.
## The worse it gets the better you are
- Rogue like game where each level you have to choose (or is selected randomly) a funny debuff that affects your gameplay. For example: see far range blurry, see only in black and white, have the controls inverted, have a random chance to get scared run from enemies, drop your weapon if you get hit, get narcolepsy.
- Other variation of the game is that the player can choose to use these debuffs because they get a better score. For example, a game where you need to survive hordes of enemies and you can decide to actively make it more difficult by getting maluses. But these debuffs should always be funny/weird/absurd.
