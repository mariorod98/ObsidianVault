# IVT Game jam 2024 - Bad is Good

Three ways that we can adapt the theme to a game:
- The goal of the game is to perform as bad as possible. The worse you perform, the better score you get.
- The goal of the game is to do or achieve something that in videogames is usually bad.
- The game gets progressively worse as you advance, so the worse it gets, the better you are.

## The worse you perform, the better score
- A singing game where your objective is to sing as off pitch as possible. The goal could be to do as opposite pitch as possible (so if the note to hit is a high note you sing it as low as possible). We could also add during the son special short phases where you have to do something like constantly switch pitch or keep a note for a period of time

## The goal is to do something commonly bad in videogames
- A local coop game where the objective is to be the first one to die. Similar to duck game. We can have a map with different hazards and the objective is to die to those hazards the first. We can add mechanics to avoid other players from beind damage like pushing them or giving them a shield or inmobilizing them.
- A game where you have an AI player trying to get the highest score and your objective is to avoid the AI from getting score. For example if they have to shoot enemies, putting obstacles or moving the enemies away. Maybe you could have a set of actions (push/pull/pick/smash) with cooldowns and you have to find imaginative ways to avoid it.
## The worse it gets the better you are
- Rogue like game where each level you have to choose (or is selected randomly) a funny debuff that affects your gameplay. For example: see far range blurry, see only in black and white, have the controls inverted, have a random chance to get scared run from enemies, drop your weapon if you get hit, get narcolepsy.
- Other variation of the game is that the player can choose to use these debuffs because they get a better score. For example, a game where you need to survive hordes of enemies and you can decide to actively make it more difficult by getting maluses. But these debuffs should always be funny/weird/absurd.

Discussion recap for Robin:
- We have discussed the different ideas proposed last week and proposed new ones. The idea that we liked the most can be resumed as: A multiplayer coop game where the objective is to be the first to die. There will be different levels with different mechanics that the players will use to either kill themselves or avoid the other players getting killed.
- We have created a GDD and defined a really barebone planification for the upcoming weeks. We have thought of some game ideas that could be fun to try. If anyone comes up with more ideas, please add them to the gdd.
- We have defined that for this week we should have the gdd writen as well as the "skeleton" of the game: movement, camera, lives system and multiplayer functionality.
- We want the game to be 2D but we are not yet sure of the camera. if it top down, we will have 2 axis of movement but no jump/gravity (or very limited). If we have a side view we will have gravity and jump but the environment will loose the 2 direction movement. We should set this decision as soon as possible (earlier this week) because it will affect both the actions of the players and the mechanics. We have added a reference of similar games for each camera view.
- We have to decide on the following topics: do we want one hit and die or have a health bar? Do we want each round to be one for all or asymetric gameplay (one tries to die the others try to avoid it).
