# Investigative Abilities
Investigative abilities allow you to gather information. ==These abilities never fail==. If you have the right ability and you look in the right place for clues, you will **always** find the information you seek.

If you lack the relevan ability, your character can talk to a friendly [[Cthulhu Confidential -Source|Source]] who will provide guidance and assurance as needed.

## How to use investigative abilities as a GM
When describind the scene, look up at what abilities does the player have and what ask yourself "**what would the character see/know at first glance about the scene?**".

When talking to a character, keep in mind the social investigative abilites to let the player know if their character notices something. For example, if they have *Assess Honesty*, they can know intuitively when someone is not saying the whole truth.

## How to use investigative abilities as a Player
After the GM introduces the scene, you can start asking questions in a particular way, either to the GM as the player or as the character to other characters, to get answers and possible clues to follow.

Describe how you gather information would gather information using a specific Ability and, if the situation is accurate enough and applies to the scene, you will get information related to that Ability, if any relevant information exists. For example if the DM describes to you that there is a beautiful sculpture in the room, you can describe how your character inspects the sculpture thoroughly to determine what movement or period could the sculpture be from, as they habve the Art History ability.

## Types of investigative abilities
These abilities can be devided into Academic, Interpersonal and Technical.
