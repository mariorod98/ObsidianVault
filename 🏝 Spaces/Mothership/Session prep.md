# Session prep
## Starting scenario
Investigate an incident in a military research space station
## The horror
**Transgression**
A frozen specimen in an asteroid has been revived for study. I started killing people and reproducing.

**Omens**
Bodies with their blood sucked.
Papers talking about the horror.
Objects appearing and disappearing.
Survivor whispering about a monster in the shadows.

**Manifestation**
The horror is a viscous monster full of legs with teeth. It is not very big and looks like a giant starfish from the void.  It screeches when attacking or being damaged. It leaves sometimes a black ooze where it goes. It smells like sea and rotten eggs when not mimicking.

It can climb walls and ceilings and jump. It can disguise itself as an object that it can copy. 

It prefers ambushing its victims. It can jump to the face and make a tight grip against its victim. It is not very tough and it hates the cold.

The horror multiplies and reproduces when feeding on victims. There are several already in the station.

**Banishment**
The only way is to kill the horrors or to criogenize them.

**Slumber**
The horror is dead forever. Or maybe it is frozen, until the next researchers want to discover their secrets. Maybe not all of them are dead, and one is able to get mimick and escape.
If the horror wins, it has taken control of the station. What will the company do to recover this precious asset?
