# Caspar David Friedrich
Caspar David Friedrich was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter. He is considered the most important German painter of his generation.

Friedrich is best known for his allegorical landscapes, which feature contemplative figures that tend to appear minuscule in contrast with the vast landscapes of misty mornings, gothic ruins and night skies.

## The use of light
What I find interesting about his art is the use of light and color. Friedrich portrays the natural light of the landscapes in a mesmerizing way.
## The Divine
> The divine is everywhere, even in a grain of sand; there I represented it in the reeds.
