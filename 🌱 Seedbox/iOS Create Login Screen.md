# iOS Create Login Screen

1. Create a new project.
2. Remove the generated ViewController, as we will create a custom one.
3. Create a new ViewController in the Main storyboard (using the + button in the top right corner or with the comand CMD+Shift+L).
4. If we launch the app, it will show a black screen because we haven't defined the entry point of the story board.
