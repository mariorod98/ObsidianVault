# iOS Create Login Screen

1. Create a new project.
2. Remove the generated ViewController, as we will create a custom one.
3. Create a new ViewController in the Main storyboard (using the + button in the top right corner or with the comand CMD+Shift+L).
4. If we launch the app, it will show a black screen because we haven't defined the entry point of the story board.
5. To select the entry point, select the controller and in the inspector Check Is Initial View Controller.
6. Now we have to create the layout.
