# Investigative abilities
Investigative abilities allow you to gather information. ==These abilities never fail==. If you have the right ability and you look in the right place for clues, you will **always** find the information you seek.

If you lack the relevan ability, your character can talk to a friendly [[Source]] who will provide guidance and assurance as needed.

## How to use investigative abilities as a DM
When describind the scene, look up at what abilities does the player have and what ask yourself "**what would the character see/know at first glance and after a quick inspection of the scene?**".

When talking to a character, keep in mind the social investigative abilites to let the player know if their character notices something. For example, if they have *Assess Honesty*, they can know intuitively when someone is not saying the whole truth.
