# Investigative abilities
Investigative abilities allow you to gather information. ==These abilities never fail==. If you have the right ability and you look in the right place for clues, you will **always** find the information you seek.

If you lack the relevan ability, your character can talk to a friendly [[Source]] who will provide guidance and assurance as needed.
