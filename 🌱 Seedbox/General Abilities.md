# General Abilities
These abilities are used in [[Challenges]] and [[Quick tests]] to determine whether you succeed or fail when traying to take actions other than gathering information.

For each General Ability, the player has a level that ranges from 1 to 3. The level determines the number of dices you will use in a [[Challenge]].
