# Probability Space
A **probability space** is a [[mathematical construct]] that provides a formal model of an experiment. A probability Space is constituted by three elements:
- **[[Sample Space]]** $\Omega$: The set of all possible outcomes from an experiment.
- **[[Event Space]]** $\mathcal{F}$: The collection of all possible events. A event $E$ is a [[subset]] in $\Omega$ othat defines an outcome or a combination of outcomes.
- **[[Probability law]]** $\mathbb{P}$: A mapping from an event $E$ to a number  $\mathbb{P}[E]$ which, ideally, measures the size of the event.
