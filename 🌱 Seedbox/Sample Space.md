# Sample Space
> [!definition] Definition (Sample space).
> A **Sample Space** $\Omega$ is the set of all possible outcomes from an experiment. We denote $\xi$ as an element in $\Omega$.

**Discrete Outcomes Examples**
- Coin flip: $\Omega =\{H, T\}$.
- Throw a dice: $\Omega=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ 
- Draw an even integer:  $\Omega=\{2, 4, 6, 8,...\}$ 

**Continuous Outcomes  Examples**
- Waiting time for metro B in Brotteaux: $\Omega=\{t |\ 0 \leq t \leq 10 min\}$. 
- Frequency of a pitch: $\Omega=\{f | 0 \leq f \leq f_{max}\}$ .

**Functional Outcome  Examples**
- $\Omega=\{f|f(x)=ax+b, a,b \in \mathbb{R}\}$ .

## Sample space and set theory
Based on the slogan [[probability is a measure of the size of a set]], we can consider the sample space as a [[universal set]] whose elements are the outcomes of the experiment.

For example, if our experiment is throwing two coins, then the sample space is: $\{(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T)\}$. In this space, each element is a pair of outcomes.

However ==not every set can be a sample space==. A sample space must be:
- **Exhaustive**: the sample space has to cover **all** the possible outcomes of the experiment.
- **Exclusive**. the sample space contains unique elements so that there is no repetition of elements.
