# Vectors
In linear algebra, a vector is just an array of numbers of n dimension. We say that the *dimension* of a vector is the number of elements in this array. A 1D vector is known as a [scalar].

In geometry, ==a *vector* is a geometric object that has magnitude and direction.==  It is represented by an arrow, the magnitude is the length of the arrow and the direction is where in the space coordinate is it pointing towards.

## Properties of vectors
### The zero vector
For any set, the *additive identity* of the set is the element *x*, such that for all *y* in the set, $y+x=y$

For the set of vectors of a particular dimension, the additive identity element is the so-called "zero-vector" of that dimension, which has zeros in every position.

$\mathbf{0}=\left[\begin{array}{c}0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0\end{array}\right]$

The zero vector is the only vector with a magnitude of zero. For any other magnitude, there are an infinite number of vectors of that magnitude.

The zero vector express the concept of "no displacement".

## Vector operations
### Negating a vector
For any set, the *additive inverse* of $x$, denoted by $-x$, is the element that yields the additive identity of that set (zero) when added to $x$. Put simply: $x+(-x)=0$.

**Algebra rules**
To negate a vector of any dimension, negate each component of the vector.
$-\left[\begin{array}{c}a_1 \\ a_2 \\ \vdots \\ a_n\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}{c}-a_1 \\ -a_2 \\ \vdots \\ -a_n\end{array}\right]$
