# Types of lighting
- A **Directional light** simulates light that is being emitted from a source that is infinitely far away. All the shadows casted by this light are parallel. It is mostly used to simulate sunlight.

- A **Point light** works like a simplified real world light bulb. It emits light equally in all directions from a point in space.

- A **Spot light** emits light from a single point in a cone shape. It has two cones: the Inner Cone Angle, where the light acheives full brightness; and the Outert Cone Angle, where a falloff takes place.

- A **Rect light** emits light into the scene from a rectangular plane with a defined width and height. It is used to simulate televisions, monitor screens, panels with lighting, etc.

- The **Sky light** captures the distant parts of the level and applies that to the scene as a light.
