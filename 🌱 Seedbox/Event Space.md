# Event Space
> [!definition] Definition (Event).
> An **event** $E$ is a subset in the sample space $\Omega$. The set of all possible events is denoted as $\mathcal{F}$.

For example, if our experiment is throwing a dice, we have that $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. Some possible events are:
- $E_1$= {even numbers} $= \{2,4,6\}$.
- $E_2$= {less than 3} $= \{1,2\}$.

==Don't confuse an outcome of sample space (the possible values of a dice) with an event (a condition satisfied by a set of the values of the dice). An event is a set of outcomes.==

A [[Sample Space]] $\Omega$ containing $n$ elements has a cardinality of $n$. However, the event space constructed from $\Omega$ will contain $2^n$ events. This is because, for every element of $\Omega$, a given event $E$ can contain the element or not.
