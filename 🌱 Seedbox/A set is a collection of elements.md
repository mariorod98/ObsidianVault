# A set is a collection of elements


Some set operations are:
- [[The union of two sets A and B contains all elements in A or B]]
- [[The intersection of two sets A and B contains all elements i A and B]]
- [[The complement of a set A is the set that contains all elements in the universal set not in A]]
- [[The difference between set A and B is the set containing all elements in A but not in B]]
