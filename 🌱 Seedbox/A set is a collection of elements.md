# A set is a collection of elements
> [!definition] Definition (Set).
> *A **set** is a collection of elements. We denote*
> $$A = \{\xi_1, \xi_2, ..., \xi_n\}$$
> *as a set, where $\xi_i$ is the ith element in the set.*

Some examples:
- $A = \{apple, orange, pear\}$ is a finite set.
- $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ is a finite set.
- $A = \{2, 4, 6, 8,...\}$ is a countable infinite set.
- $A = \{x | 0 < x < 1\}$ is an uncountable set.

If an elements is included in a set, we write $\xi_i \in A$.


## Subsets
> [!definition] Definition (Subset).
> *B is a **subset** of A if for any $\xi_i \in B$, $\xi_i$ is also in A. We write*
> $$B \subseteq A$$
> *to denote that B is a subset of A.*

B is called a *proper subset* of A if B is a subset of A and $B \neq A$. Two sets A and B are equal if and only if $B \subseteq A$ and $A \subseteq B$.


## Empty and universal set
> [!definition] Definition (Empty Set).
> *A set is **empty** if it contains no elements. It is denoted*
> $$A = \emptyset$$

> [!definition] Definition (Universal Set).
> *The **universal set** is the set containing all elements under consideration. It is denoted as*
> $$A = \Omega$$


## Union of two sets
The **union** of two sets A and B contains **all** ellements of A *or* B. The union is always larger or equal to the individual set.

Some set operations are:
- [[The union of two sets A and B contains all elements in A or B]]
- [[The intersection of two sets A and B contains all elements i A and B]]
- [[The complement of a set A is the set that contains all elements in the universal set not in A]]
- [[The difference between set A and B is the set containing all elements in A but not in B]]
