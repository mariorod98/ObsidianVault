# What is an activity?
An *Activity* is the basic building block of an Android app. It can be described as ==a single, focused thing that the user can do==.

In desktop apps, the entry point is always the same: you open the app and you are welcomed by the same initial screen. However, in mobile-apps, the user doesn't always begin in the same place. 

For example, opening the mail app from the home screen may open the inbox with a list of mails. However, opening the app from a photo to send the photo may open with a new email with the photo loaded.
