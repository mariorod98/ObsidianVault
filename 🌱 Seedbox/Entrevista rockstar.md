# Entrevista rockstar

### Describe yourself in one line

### What is your salary expectation

For what I have seen across the industrie, the salary I expect is around 30 000 a year.

### Which person do you most admire in the video game development industry

### If you could improve your video game development capabilities, which area would you choose to focus?

### When have you applied a unique or creative approach to solving a difficult development problem?

### Rockstar Games developers often work overtime to meet deadlines. How do you feel about crunching?

### What is your favorite Rockstar Games title and why?

My favorite title from Rockstar Games is Red Dead Redemption 2. I love that game because it is a huge living world where you can spend hundreds of hours interacting with its systems without even touching the main story line. 

### Are you comfortable working in a fast-paced environment?

### Why do you want to work at Rockstar Games?

### Describe some of the features that make a good video game.

### Tell us about your experience developing software for games.

### How would you approach designing a new feature or level for a game?

### What are your thoughts on the gaming industry right now?

I think the industry is more democratized than ever. Indie games keep rising and raising the bar of what a small team can do while AAA games keep exploring what are the boundaries of video games and how realistic can they be.

### Why should we hire you over someone else?

### Have you ever worked on a cross functional team before?
Of course, I am currently working in a small team of 16 people, where we have 7 programmers, 3 designers and 6 artists. We are working together to release a small videogame on Steam and it is our first experience in such an environment.

### How often do you check up on your teammates when working together on a project?

I try to do this at least on a weekly basis. For me it is important to know what are my peers working on and how are they handling it. It helps me stay organized and have a general idea of how the team is performing.

### What was the most difficult part about working on a group project?
I think the most difficult part is having efficient and effective communication. Communication is crucial when working on group projects so having it be smooth, fast and effective is vital, otherwise it can impact negatively on the project outcome. 

For example, in the project I am currently working on, we had a communication problem where most of the communication between the programming a design departments was funneled through one representative of each department. This slowed down the communication and gave extra work to those representatives. We decided to scrap that model and now the communication is direct between the programmer and the designer.

### Some people say that gaming can negatively impact people’s lives. What are your thoughts on this?
I think gamming can impact people's lives as negatively and positively as any other type of media and art. It is down to the individual how they shape their relationship with videogames and I think it has more to do with the person's environment and social situation than with the games they play.

### Which tasks do you prefer doing as a programmer?
As a programmer, what I enjoy the most is iterating over some feature that my teams is implementing. Receive feedback, test bugs, fix and improve the feature over again until it is perfect.

### What is a system?

### What is the entity component system
