# Entrevista rockstar

### Why do I want to work at Rockstar

- Rockstar is one of the biggest and most influential developers right now. I want to work there to learn from the best of the industry.
- Rockstar games have always been a part of my life since I was a teenager. They have given me such joyful and immersive experience that I want to be part of the team delivering dose experiences.

### What are your strengths and weaknesses

- My biggest strengths are that I am very patient and calm, whenever I am facing some challenge or I am in a difficult situation, I tend to not panic. Instead I try to work out a solution or ask for help.
- A weakness I have is that I do not speak out my opinion because I fear I might be wrong or that the people I am talking to do not want to hear what I have to say. Specially if what I am saying is negative.

### Why should I hire you? Why do you stand out?
As part of my last year studying Videogames Programming, I am developing a custom graphics engine in C++ from scratch. From design to scheduling, implementation and testing. I am learning so much about designing principles and modern C++ that I feel I can be a great fit to this position. 


### What is a system?
A system is a process that has a specific function that is performed on a group of components. For example, a physics system would take all the associated components to calculate the results of applying forces.

### How often do you check up on your teammates when working together on a project?

I try to do this at least on a weekly basis. For me it is important to know what are my peers working on and how are they handling it. It helps me stay organized and have a general idea of how the team is performing.


### Which tasks do you prefer doing as a programmer?
As a programmer, what I enjoy the most is iterating over some feature that my teams is implementing. Receive feedback, test bugs, fix and improve the feature over again until it is perfect.


### Have you ever worked on a cross functional team before?
Of course, I am currently working in a small team of 16 people, where we have 7 programmers, 3 designers and 6 artists. We are working together to release a small videogame on Steam and it is our first experience in such an environment.

### What was the most difficult part about working on a group project?
I think the most difficult part is having efficient and effective communication. Communication is crucial when working on group projects so having it be smooth, fast and effective is vital, otherwise it can impact negatively on the project outcome. 

For example, in the project I am currently working on, we had a communication problem where most of the communication between the programming a design departments was funneled through one representative of each department. This slowed down the communication and gave extra work to those representatives. We decided to scrap that model and now the communication is direct between the programmer and the designer.

### Some people say that gaming can negatively impact people’s lives. What are your thoughts on this?
I think gamming can impact people's lives as negatively and positively as any other type of media and art. It is down to the individual how they shape their relationship with videogames and I think it has more to do with the person's environment and social situation than with the games they play.
