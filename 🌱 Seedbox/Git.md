# Git

## What is Git?
Git is a Distributed [[Version Control System]] (VSC) that tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on a project together. It is the most common VSC used nowadays.

## How does git work?
Git works by tracking the **changes** made into the **files** that conform the **repository** of a project. 

Git has three environments where these changes live. These are:
- The **working directory** is the place that holds the actual files of the repository. It is the place where you create, delete and modify files. ==It is the project's directory in your computer system==.
- - The **stage** (or index) is an intermediate space between the **working directory** and the **repository**. It stores all the changes made in the **working directory** that you want to [[commit]] to the **repository**. It can be defined as a preview of your next commit.
- The **repository** contains the files of the project and the history of all the changes made. When you [[commit]] a change, the changes from the **stage** are stored in the repository's history with a unique UUID.
