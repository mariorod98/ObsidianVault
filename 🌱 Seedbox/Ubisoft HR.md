## Experiences
### UNICOM
- I worked there for 8 months.
- We worked with SCRUM methodology, where I had daily meetings of 15 mins where the team discussed the progress of the previous day and which where the tasks we would be focusing on that day.
- I had to create my own task and estimate the duration of the task.
- We were five programmers divided into two teams. One team was a senior and a junior working on the transport scheduling program. I was in another team with another senior and another junior and then there was another programmer that was in charge of another program.
- I worked closely with QA to develop a key feature in my project.

Some of the main challenges I faced were:
- I had to develop features that required a lot of knowledge about finances and Spanish taxes. So I had to research a lot about those topics. Luckily I had two colleagues in the company that worked in consumer service and QA and knew everything about these topics.
- I started working in a new company with a programming language that was obscure, with basically no information on internet. I had to work on a program I did not understand at first. It was like entering a black hole of knowledge. I had to put a lot of effort the first months to learn everything I could. In the end it all paid off.


### ESAT
- I am part of a interdisciplinary team developing a 2.5 platformer that we aim to release on Steam this summer.
- I work in a team of 8 programmers, 6 artists and 3 designers.


Some of the main challenges I faced were:
- Being a team of 8 programmers with no direct leadership, sort of a horizontal structure, we had to figure out, collectively, what each individual would be doing and we had to do this in a way were the workload was equally shared.
- For the first months of the project the programming team was kind of isolated from the rest of the teams, as we were creating the structure of the game. We talked a bit with the design team about how a mechanic would work or to receive feedback, but we did not cross words with the art team. However, now we are implementing the animations, materials and meshes that they have created so the project is currently in a phase where everyone needs to talk with everyone. The communication can be quite chaotic if, for example, two artists give different feedback to a programmer or ask for things that oppose each other. 


## Questions
- How do you avoid burnout and crunch?
- Do you track the wellbeing or satisfaction of your employees?
- How do you promote employees? Is the position static or are we able to move up?
- Do you have any budget for employee training/learning? Assist conferences or buy books or courses.
