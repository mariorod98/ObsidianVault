## Experiences
### UNICOM
- I worked there for 8 months.
- We worked with SCRUM methodology, where I had daily meetings of 15 mins where the team discussed the progress of the previous day and which where the tasks we would be focusing on that day.
- I had to create my own task and estimate the duration of the task.
- We were five programmers divided into two teams. One team was a senior and a junior working on the transport scheduling program. I was in another team with another senior and another junior and then there was another programmer that was in charge of another program.
- I worked closely with QA to develop a key feature in my project.

Some of the main challenges I faced were:
- I had to develop features that required a lot of knowledge about finances and Spanish taxes. So I had to research a lot about those topics. Luckily I had two colleagues in the company that worked in consumer service and QA and knew everything about these topics.
- I started working in a new company with a programming language that was obscure, with basically no information on internet. I had to work on a program I did not understand at first. It was like entering a black hole of knowledge. I had to put a lot of effort the first months to learn everything I could. In the end it all paid off.


### ESAT
- I am part of a interdisciplinary team developing a 2.5 platformer that we aim to release on Steam this summer.
- I work in a team of 8 programmers, 6 artists and 3 designers.

## Questions
- How do you avoid burnout and crunch?
- Do you track the wellbeing or satisfaction of your employees?
- How do you promote employees? Is the position static or are we able to move up?
- Do you have any budget for employee training/learning? Assist conferences or buy books or courses.
