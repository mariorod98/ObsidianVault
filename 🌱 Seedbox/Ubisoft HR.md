## Experiences
### UNICOM
- I worked there for 8 months.
- We worked with SCRUM methodology, where I had daily meetings of 15 mins where the team discussed the progress of the previous day and which where the tasks we would be focusing on that day.
- I had to create my own task and estimate the duration of the task.
- We were five programmers divided into two teams. One team was a senior and a junior working on the transport scheduling program. I was in another team with another senior and another junior and then there was another programmer that was in charge of another program.
- I had to implement a very important feature for the finance program so I had to be in 


## Questions
- How do you avoid burnout and crunch?
- Do you track the wellbeing or satisfaction of your employees?
- How do you promote employees? Is the position static or are we able to move up?
- Do you have any budget for employee training/learning? Assist conferences or buy books or courses.
